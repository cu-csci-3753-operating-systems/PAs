## Shared Array

### File overview
- [`input/`](../common/hostnames): directory of text files as suggested sample input
  - You should determine an appropriate array size from here. Your array implementation (and this input) will be used in [extra credit PA2](../threaded_resolver)
- `array.c`: where your thread-safe shared array implementation should live
- `array.h`: header file for your shared array implementation
- `stack.c`: example stack implementation
- `stack.h`: example header file containing stack function prototypes
- `stack_test.c`: test program to demonstrate the usage of the example stack
  - `gcc stack.c stack_test.c` to compile this
